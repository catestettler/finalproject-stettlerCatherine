This is a simple, text-based story where the user makes choices through the python console that takes them down different paths. There are currently five different endings.
The story is a variation of "Hansel and Gretel," where the user comes across a witch in the forest who plans to eat a couple of children.

The main program is located "textadventure.py"

You can end the story five different ways:
  1. Ignore the witch entirely
  2. Turn a blind eye to the witch and the children
  3. Inspire the children to rescue themselves
  4. Save the children with your survival skills
  5. Convince the witch to let you and the kids go
