This is a simple, text-based story where the user makes choices through the python console that takes them down different paths. There are currently five different endings.
The story is a variation of "Hansel and Gretel," where the user comes across a witch in the forest who plans to eat a couple of children.
You can end the story five different ways:
  Ignore the witch entirely
  Turn a blind eye to the witch and the children
  Inspire the children to rescue themselves
  Save the children with your survival skills
  Convince the witch to let you and the kids go
